MAD LAB Part-B Program-8 MINI Project 6th SEM

Create an AIDL service that calculates Car Loan EMI.
The formula to calculate EMI isE = P * (r(1+r)n)/((1+r)n-1)
where
E = The EMI payable on the car loan amount 
P = The Car loan Principal Amountr = The interest rate value computed on a monthly basis n = The loan tenure in the form of months
The down  payment amount  has to  be deducted from  the principal amount paid towardsbuying the Car. 
Develop an application that makes use of this AIDL service to calculate the EMI.  
Thisapplication   should   have   four   EditText   to   read   the   PrincipalAmount,
DownPayment, Interest  Rate,Loan Term (in months) and a button named as 
“Calculate MonthlyEMI”. On click of this button,the result should be shown in a TextView. 
Also, calculate theEMI by varying the Loan Term andInterest Rate values.
